  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a> is a great micro-framework to create REST-like APIs,
  however its strongest point is, at the same time, its weakest point: there's no structure, so you can decide how
  to structure your code, how to define your app architecture and that could lead to ... a big mess, because a project
  without order could become unmaintainable.
</p>
<p>
  Grapevine is an opinionated structure - with desires to become a framework ;) - to use
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">grape</a> to create REST-like APIs.
</p>
<p>
  This structure includes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.github.com/apotonick/roar">roar</a> for <a href="resources.html#hypermediaApi">hypermediaAPI</a>
  in case you want to deliver your api that way. It also includes rspec and debugger so you can start testing your api as soon as you begin writing it.
</p>
<p>
  Please refer to <a href="docs.html">docs</a> so you can see what you get besides the possibility to start with an structure
</p>
<p>
  Last but not least (in fact I think this is the main feature of grapevine), it's the structure which tries to keep good practices for
  class separations and mainly around the <a href="resources.html#dci">DCI</a> concept. Keep in mind that instead of using <strong>Interaction</strong> the proposed name
  is <strong>Information</strong>, why? because when you interact with a service you're asking it for information.
